<h1> Project:  Jenkins CI/CD With GitHub Integration </h1> 

<h2> Project Overview: </h2>
<p>"The Jenkins CI/CD with GitHub Integration project is all about making software development easier. It sets up a system where the computer does a lot of the work for us, making everything faster, more reliable, and helping teams work together better.

By connecting Jenkins with GitHub, the project makes it easy to check our code, test it automatically, and put it where it needs to go without any hiccups." </p>


<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<h2>Continuous Integration (CI):</h2>  
<p>* When we make changes to our code and save them on GitHub, this system automatically starts building our code. It checks if everything works together smoothly, catching any problems early on before they become big issues. </p>

<h2>Continuous Delivery (CD):</h2>
<p>* Enable automated deployment of applications to different environments (e.g., development, sstaging, production) based on predefined criteria.</p>
<p>* Implement blue-green deployments or canary releases too minimize downtime and risk during updates.</p>

<h2>GitHub Integration:</h2>
<p>* Utilize GitHub webhooks to trigger Jenkins builds on code commits or pull requests.</p>
<p>* Integrate Jenkins with GitHub Actions, enabling the use of GitHub Actions workflows within the CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h2>Pipeline as Code:</h2>
<p>* Define and manage CI/CD pipelines using Jenkinsfile, allowing version control    and easy replication across projects.</p>
<p>* Leverage Jenkins Pipeline DSL for flexibility  and and customization.</p>
