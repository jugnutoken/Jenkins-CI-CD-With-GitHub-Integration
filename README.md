<h1> Project:  Jenkins CI/CD With GitHub Integration </h1> 

<h2> Project Overview: </h2>
<p>"The Jenkins CI/CD with GitHub Integration project is all about making software development easier. It sets up a system where the computer does a lot of the work for us, making everything faster, more reliable, and helping teams work together better.

By connecting Jenkins with GitHub, the project makes it easy to check our code, test it automatically, and put it where it needs to go without any hiccups." </p>


<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<h2>Continuous Integration (CI):</h2>  
<p>* When we make changes to our code and save them on GitHub, this system automatically starts building our code. It checks if everything works together smoothly, catching any problems early on before they become big issues. </p>

<h2>Continuous Delivery (CD):</h2>
<p>* This system automatically sends our code to different places, like testing or the live website, based on rules we've set. It helps us update our apps smoothly without causing downtime or breaking things for our users. </p>

<h2>GitHub Integration:</h2>
<p>* We use a feature in GitHub called "webhooks" to tell Jenkins to start building our code whenever we make changes or suggest them (called pull requests). Also, we connect Jenkins with GitHub Actions, so we can use GitHub's own tools to manage our code building and deploying process. </p>

<h2>Pipeline as Code:</h2>
<p>* Define and manage CI/CD pipelines using Jenkinsfile, allowing version control    and easy replication across projects.</p>
<p>* Leverage Jenkins Pipeline DSL for flexibility  and and customization.</p>
