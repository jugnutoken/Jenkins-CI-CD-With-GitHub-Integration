<h1> Project:  Jenkins CI/CD With GitHub Integration </h1> 

<h2> Project Overview: </h2>
<p>"The Jenkins CI/CD with GitHub Integration project is all about making software development easier. It sets up a system where the computer does a lot of the work for us, making everything faster, more reliable, and helping teams work together better.

By connecting Jenkins with GitHub, the project makes it easy to checck our code, test it aautomatically, and put it where it needs to go without any hiccups." </p>


<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<h2>Continuous Integration (CI):</h2>  
<p>* When we make changes to our code and save them on GitHub, this system automatically starts building our code. It checks if everything works together smoothly, catching any problems early on before they become big issues. </p>

<h2>Continuous Delivery (CD):</h2>
<p>* This system automatically sends our code to different places, like testing or the live website, based on rules we've set. It helps us update our apps smoothly without causing downtime or breaking things for our users. </p>

<h2>GitHub Integration:</h2>
<p>* We use a feature in GitHub called "webhooks" to tell Jenkins to start buillding our code whenever wee make changes or suggest them (called pull requests). Also, we connect Jenkins with GitHub Actions, so we can use GitHub's own tools to manage our code building and deploying process. </p>

<h2>Pipeline as Code:</h2>
<p>* Imagine you have a blueprint for building and delivering software. With a tool called Jenkinsfile, you can define and control this blueprint, making sure everything happens just the way you want it to, every time you work on a new project.</p>

<p>* This blueprint is like a recipe, and Jenkins uses its special language (DSL) to make sure it's super flexible and can be customized to fit your project perfectly." .</p>
