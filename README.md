<h1> Project:  Jenkins CICD with GitHub Integration </h1> 

<h2> Project Overview: </h2>
<p>The Jenkins CI/CD with GitHub Integration project aims to automate the software development lifecycle, enhancing efficiency, reliability, and collaboration among development teams. By integrating Jenkins with GitHub, the project facilitates continuous integration, automated testing, and seamless deployment.</p>


<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<h2>Continuous Integration (CI):</h2>
<p>* Automatically trigger builds on code changes pushed to GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>* Validate code changes through automated builds to identify integration issues early in the development process.</p>

<h2>Continuous Delivery (CD):</h2>
<p>* Enable automated deployment of applications to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) based on predefined criteria.</p>
<p>* Implement blue-green deployments or canary releases to minimize downtime and risk during updates.</p>

<h2>GitHub Integration:</h2>
<p>* Utilize GitHub webhooks to trigger Jenkins builds on code commits or pull requests.</p>
<p>* Integrate Jenkins with GitHub Actions, enabling the use of GitHub Actions workflows within the CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h2>Pipeline as Code:</h2>
<p>* Define and manage CI/CD pipelines using Jenkinsfile, allowing version control    and easy replication across projects.</p>
<p>* Leverage Jenkins Pipeline DSL for flexibility and customization.</p>
